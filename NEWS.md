# Development version

## Major changes
* Changed name of `demultiplex()` to `meta_demultiplex()`
* All dependencies on taxize have now been removed as the package has been deprecated on CRAN for the foreseeable future. We have now shifted our dependency for NCBI lookups to the `taxonomizr` database. The vignette and example script on our website have been updated to reflect this. See new function `download_accessions()`
* Increased efficiency of MetaBlast module

## Minor changes
* Added publicly hosted files to our [website](https://wejlab.github.io/metascope-docs/articles/vignette_docs/publicly_hosted_indices_and_accessions.html)

## Bug fixes
* Changed dependency of data.table to properly compress files.

# MetaScope 1.3.7 (Bioc 3.19)

## Bug Fixes
* Identified the Rbowtie2 parameter k as being doubled when specified for bowtie filter or align steps.
* Added another call to taxize in `convert_animalcules()` to catch any accessions that were not mapped to a UID in `metascope_id()`, in addition to another call in `metascope_id()` itself

## Major changes
* Altered `bt2_params` objects to reflect 98% identity (16S), 95% identity (metagenomics) and added a parameter for when the origin genome is thought to not be present in the reference database.
* Added SILVA `species_headers` object called internally in `convert_animalcules_silva`
* Added `convert_animalcules_silva` function

# MetaScope 1.2.0 (Bioc 3.18)

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed taxonomy table function to output correctly formatted table
* Fixed examples for various functions that were calling genomes with download_refseq but genomes were not able to be found.
* Fixed plot generation for `metascope_id()`
* Fixed premature stopping of `download_refseq` for strains labeled as "no rank" in NCBI.
* Fixed identification of reads as unknown genomes (due to outdated reference databases that identify genomes now removed from NCBI). The unknown genomes will now be distinctly identified based on NCBI accession ID, which will separate them in the final results. IDs can also be looked up manually (on NCBI website) to see what the reads were aligning to.
* Incorporated unknown taxa (removed from NCBI databases) into output of `convert_animalcules()`

## Major changes
* Added ability to identify reads from databases other than NCBI (known to work for Silva and Greengenes2)

# MetaScope 0.99.0 (4/19/2022)

* Pre-Release version of MetaScope

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed check error message about `data.table::fread` for reading .gz files by adding `R.utils` to imports.

## Major Changes
* Submitted to Bioconductor
