# The SILVA database

MetaScope is compatible with the SILVA 16S rRNA Database. At the time of writing, the [most recent update](https://www.arb-silva.de/) to SILVA is version 138.1 (released on August 27, 2020). 

**Important**
If you want to use the `convert_animalcules_silva()` step, you'll need to use the premade Bowtie2 indices of SILVA 138.1 available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dS60VcYHDbAObKSi_oGoQuf7XFOejaKj?usp=drive_link).

You can follow the `align_target_bowtie` usage outlined in the MetaScope tutorial, replacing the `libs` parameter with the SILVA indices.

When you reach the `metascope_id()` step, you will need to include the parameter `db = "silva"` in the function call to identify down to the genus level using the SILVA taxonomy identifiers. 


All CSV outputs from `metascope_id()` can be compiled into a single MultiAssayExperiment object with the `convert_animalcules_silva()` function as shown here with false filenames:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
out_res <- convert_animalcules_silva(
  meta_counts = all_files,
  annot_path = "animalcules_metadata.csv",
  which_annot_col = "Filename",
  end_string = ".metascope_id.csv",
  qiime_biom_out = FALSE,
  path_to_write = "."
)

saveRDS(out_res, "silva_consolidated_results.RDS")
```
